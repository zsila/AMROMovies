- Mappers (DTO → Domain)

Responsibilities:
- Networking
- Data transformation

---

### **Domain Layer**

- Business models
- Repository interface
- Use cases

Responsibilities:
- Business logic (filtering, sorting)
- No Android / Retrofit dependencies

---

### **Presentation Layer**
Contains:
- ViewModels
- Compose UI screens
- UI state management

Responsibilities:

- **Dependency Injection:** Hilt
- **Networking:** Retrofit + OkHttp
- **JSON Parsing:** Gson
- **Image Loading:** Coil
- **Concurrency:** Kotlin Coroutines
- **State Management:** StateFlow
- **Testing:** JUnit4, Coroutines Test, MockWebServer

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Obtain TMDB API Key 
Create an API key from:

https://www.themoviedb.org/

---

### 2️⃣ Configure `local.properties`

Create (or edit) `local.properties` in the project root:

```properties
TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY (paste just the key, wihout a " at the start/end of the string)
```

---
### 3️⃣ Build & Run

1. Open project in Android Studio

2. Sync Gradle

3. Run the app configuration

---

### 🧪 Running Tests

Run unit tests:

  ./gradlew test

---

### ⚠️ Notes & Tradeoffs

- API key is injected via BuildConfig using local.properties

- Error handling is intentionally simple for assignment scope

- Paging is handled manually to fetch Top 100 movies

---

### 🔮 Possible Improvements

 - Offline caching (Room)

 - Paging 3 integration

 - Enhanced error handling (typed failures)

 - UI animations and nicer-looking UI

 - More UI & integration tests
